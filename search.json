While you don’t need an account to download the course materials, you will need one to receive and submit your assignments (this will be explained in details during the exercise classes). You can apply for the GitHub student benefits at https://education.github.com/pack. If approved you can receive free access to the GitHub Pro plan and to GitHub Copilot, an AI tool that helps you write code.\nOpen https://cran.r-project.org/, and you will find links to R builds for different operating systems. Click on the link matching your operating system and choose the latest version of R. When using the Windows operating system, you will see a link “Install R for the first time .” Click on this link and then download the R installer. Run the installer. Leave the default settings unchanged unless you know what you are doing.\nAfter installing R, open https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. If the web page recognizes your operating system, you will see a download button (right side of the page) for R studio. If the button does not appear, scroll down the page and find the installer appropriate for your operating system.\nShould you encounter difficulties installing R and R Studio, you can watch these video guides:\n\n\nWindows\nMac\nUbuntu 22.04\n\n\nHere are some video guides on how to install git:\n\n\nWindows\nMac\nLinux\n\n\nThe following steps depend on git being installed. Open R Studio and open a new project dialog: File -&gt; New Project. In the dialog, click on the third option: version control. From the next menu, select git.\n\n  \nIn the Repository URL field, paste the address of the course repository:\nhttps://github.com/febse/econ2024.git\n Click on the Create Project button and wait for git R studio to clone the repository and open the project.\n 6. The content of the GitHub repository will be updated continuously throughout the semester. In order to download the new files or updated versions of already existing files, you can use git pull. Open the git window in the upper right pane of R studio and click the pull button. This will download all changes from the GitHub repository to your local copy.\n\n\n\nStep 7\n\n\n\nNote that if you have modified the files tracked by git that have changed in the repository, git pull will fail with an error similar to this one:\n\n\n\n\nPull error\n\n\nTo avoid this, you can roll back the file to its original state. Right-click on the file in the git window and choose “revert.”\n\n\n\nRevert\n\n\n\nIn the exercise classes, we will use many functions from the tidyverse system and several other packages. Before accessing these packages’ functionality, you need to install them first. Find the R console in R studio and paste the following line on the command line. Press enter to run it and wait for the installation to complete.\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"tidyverts\", \"xts\", \"quantmod\", \"urca\"))\n\n\n\n\nInstall packages\n\n\nOptional: more on Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/guide/\nOptional: a base R cheatsheet: https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/getting-started-r",

    "text": "1.6 Recycling\nIf you try to perform an operation on two vectors of different lengths, R will recycle the shorter vector to match the length of the longer vector. This is called recycling or broadcasting.\nLet’s run an example to see how recycling works. We want to add a scalar to each element of a vector. Mathematically, this does not make sense, because you can only add/subtract element-wise two vectors of the same length. However, R will recycle the scalar to match the length of the vector. Recycling means that it creates a new vector by repeating the shorter vector until it has the same length as the longer vector.\n\nc(2, 5) + 1\n\n[1] 3 6\n\n\n\nc(2, 3, 5, 7) + c(10, 20)\n\n[1] 12 23 15 27\n\nc(2, 3, 5, 7) / c(10, 20)\n\n[1] 0.20 0.15 0.50 0.35\n\n\nTake care when using recycling, because it can lead to unexpected results. For example, if you try to add two vectors of different lengths, R will still recycle the shorter vector to match the length of the longer vector, but it will also issue a warning.\n\nc(2, 5) + c(1, 2, 10)\n\nWarning in c(2, 5) + c(1, 2, 10): longer object length is not a multiple of\nshorter object length\n\n\n[1]  3  7 12\n\n\nPay attention to the warning message.

Due to the way floating point numbers are represented in the computer, you may get unexpected results when comparing them. This is because floating point numbers are not stored exactly in the computer. For example, the number 0.1 cannot be represented exactly in binary, so it is stored as an approximation. This can lead to unexpected results when comparing floating point numbers. For example, you may get a result like this:\n\nsqrt(2)^2 == 2\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nMathematically, \\sqrt(2)^2 is exactlyequal to 2, but the comparison returns FALSE.\nThis is because sqrt(2)^2 is computed with a finite precision and is not equal to 2. When printing the number in the console you may not see the difference because the print function formats the number. To compare floating point numbers, you should use the all.equal function, which takes into account the fact that floating point numbers are not stored exactly in the computer.\n\nall.equal(sqrt(2)^2, 2)\n\n[1] TRUE",

    "text": "1.10 Functions\nFunctions are a fundamental building block most languages, including R. They are used to carry out a specific task and encapsulate a sequence of steps. You can avoid repeating the same code over and over again by abstracting the code into a function.\nYou can think of a function as a recipe. It takes some ingredients (arguments) and returns a dish (output).\nLet’s look at some examples of functions in R, without going into too much detail.\nTo define a function, you use the function keyword and assing the function to a variable. The function is then called by using the variable name and passing the arguments in parentheses. The function has a body that is enclosed in curly braces.\nLet’s write a function that takes two numbers and returns TRUE or FALSE depending on whether the sum of the arguments is odd. Functions return the value of the last expression in the body of the function unless you explicitly use the return keyword.\n\nis_even_sum &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  (x + y) %% 2 == 0\n}\n\nis_even_sum(2, 3)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_even_sum(2, 4)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThe %% operator is the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the first number by the second number.\n\n2 %% 2\n\n[1] 0\n\n3 %% 2\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nWriting functions is a large topic and we will not cover all the details in this course. You can find more information about functions in R in the R documentation.\nA thing to note is that R is (mostly) a functional programming language and functions generally do not modify their arguments. This means that if you pass a vector to a function and the function modifies the vector, the original vector will not be changed. This is different from many other languages, where functions can modify their arguments. The reason for this is that arguments are copied when they are passed to a function. This is done to avoid side effects and make the code easier to reason about.\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\n\nf &lt;- function(y) {\n  y[1] &lt;- 100\n  y\n}\n\nf(x)\n\n[1] 100   2   3\n\nx\n\n[1] 1 2 3",

Let i index the observation in our data set from the first (i = 1) to the last i = n. In our case n = 1816: the number of all interviewed customers. We can represent the values of some (numeric) characteristic (e.g., the persons’ weight) as a vector of values x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n). In this notation x_1 is the weight of the first customer in the data set (x_1 = 210 pounds). The arithmetic average is defined as the sum of all values divided by the number of observations:\n\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}(x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i\n\nLet us now compute the arithmetic average of weight and height.

This means that about half of the customers were taller than 66 inches.\n\n\n2.1.2 Variability\nThe next important feature of the data is its variability. It answers the following question: how different are the customers between each other with respect to body height (for example). There are numerous ways to measure variability.\nOne intuitive measure would be the range of the data, defined as the difference by the maximal observed height and the minimal observed height\n\nmin(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 57\n\nmax(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 82\n\nrange(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 57 82\n\n\n\nmax(earnings$height) - min(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 25\n\n\nAnother measure is the inter-quartile range. The quartiles are defined similar to the median. To see this lets use the example of body height. The first quartile of height (25-th percentile and 0.25 quantile are different names for the same thing) is the height for which about one quarter of the customers are shorter than it. You can compute it with the function quantile.\n\nquantile(earnings$height, 0.25)\n\n25% \n 64 \n\n\nAbout 25 percent of our customers were shorter than 64 inches.\nThe second quartile is the same as the median (two quarters).\n\nquantile(earnings$height, 0.5)\n\n50% \n 66 \n\nmedian(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 66\n\n\nThe third quartile is the height for which three quarter of the customers are shorter than it.\n\nquantile(earnings$height, 0.75)\n\n  75% \n69.25 \n\n\nIn our case about three quarter of the customers were shorter than 69.25 inches.\nThe inter-quartile range is simply the difference between the third quartile and the second quartile.\n\nquantile(earnings$height, 0.75) - quantile(earnings$height, 0.25)\n\n 75% \n5.25 \n\n\nAbout half of our customers had a hight between the first quartile (64 inches) and the third quartile (69.25 inches). The inter-quartile range shows you the difference between the height of the talles person and the shortest person for the central 50 percent of the customers.\nAs the range, the inter-quartile range is a measure of variability.\nThe most important measure of variability and the one that will be central to our analysis is the (empirical) variance.\n\nDefinition 2.1 (Empirical variance) For a vector of values x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n) it is defined as the average (apart from a small correction in the denominator) squared deviation of the values from their mean.\n\nS^2_x = \\frac{(x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 + \\ldots + (x_n - \\bar{x}^2)}{n - 1} = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2: \\quad \\text{variance}\\\\\nS_x = \\sqrt{S^2_x} \\quad \\text{standard deviation}\n\n\n\nExample 2.1 (Computing the empirical variance) Lets apply the formula from Definition 2.1 to a very simple example with just three values.\n\nx_1 = -1, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 4\n\nFirst, the empirical mean of these values is\n\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{-1 + 0 + 4}{3} = 1\n\nNow lets substitute these values in the definition of the empirical variance:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nS^2_{x} & = \\frac{(x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\bar{x})^2 + (x_3 - \\bar{x})^2 }{n - 1} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{(-1 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 + (4 - 1)^2 }{3 - 1} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{(-2)^2 + (- 1)^2 + (3 )^2 }{2} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{4 + 1 + 9 }{2} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{14}{2} \\\\\n        & = 7\n\\end{aligned}\n Using R to compute the same thing:\n\nx &lt;- c(-1, 0, 4)\nx_avg &lt;- mean(x)\n\n((-1 - x_avg)^2 + (0 - x_avg)^2 + (4 - x_avg)^2) / (length(x) - 1)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nThere is also a special function var that can compute it from a vector\n\nvar(x)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nThe (empirical) standard deviation is simply the square root of the (empirical) variance.\n\nS_x = \\sqrt{S^2_x} = \\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.64\n\nIn R you have two options: take the square root of the result of var using the sqrt function or use sd (standard deviation) to compute the standard deviation directly.\n\nsqrt(var(x))\n\n[1] 2.645751\n\nsd(x)\n\n[1] 2.645751\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe following contains code discussed during the classes without additional explanations\n\n\n\n## Basic summaries for the whole tibble\nearnings %&gt;% skimr::skim()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nPiped data\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1816\n\n\nNumber of columns\n17\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n16\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nethnicity\n0\n1\n5\n8\n0\n4\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nheight\n0\n1.00\n66.57\n3.83\n57.00\n64.00\n66.00\n69.25\n82.00\n▂▇▅▁▁\n\n\nweight\n27\n0.99\n156.31\n34.62\n80.00\n130.00\n150.00\n180.00\n342.00\n▅▇▃▁▁\n\n\nmale\n0\n1.00\n0.37\n0.48\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n1.00\n1.00\n▇▁▁▁▅\n\n\nearn\n0\n1.00\n21147.30\n22531.77\n0.00\n6000.00\n16000.00\n27000.00\n400000.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nearnk\n0\n1.00\n21.15\n22.53\n0.00\n6.00\n16.00\n27.00\n400.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\neducation\n2\n1.00\n13.24\n2.56\n2.00\n12.00\n12.00\n15.00\n18.00\n▁▁▁▇▃\n\n\nmother_education\n244\n0.87\n13.61\n3.22\n3.00\n12.00\n13.00\n16.00\n99.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nfather_education\n295\n0.84\n13.65\n3.25\n3.00\n12.00\n13.00\n16.00\n99.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nwalk\n0\n1.00\n5.30\n2.60\n1.00\n3.00\n6.00\n8.00\n8.00\n▃▁▃▁▇\n\n\nexercise\n0\n1.00\n3.05\n2.32\n1.00\n1.00\n2.00\n5.00\n7.00\n▇▁▁▁▃\n\n\nsmokenow\n1\n1.00\n1.75\n0.44\n1.00\n1.00\n2.00\n2.00\n2.00\n▃▁▁▁▇\n\n\ntense\n1\n1.00\n1.42\n2.16\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n2.00\n7.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nangry\n1\n1.00\n1.42\n2.16\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n2.00\n7.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nage\n0\n1.00\n42.93\n17.16\n18.00\n29.00\n39.00\n56.00\n91.00\n▇▇▃▃▁\n\n\nheight_cm\n0\n1.00\n169.08\n9.73\n144.78\n162.56\n167.64\n175.89\n208.28\n▂▇▅▁▁\n\n\nweight_kg\n27\n0.99\n70.34\n15.58\n36.00\n58.50\n67.50\n81.00\n153.90\n▅▇▃▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable(earnings$ethnicity)\n\n\n   Black Hispanic    Other    White \n     180      104       38     1494",
